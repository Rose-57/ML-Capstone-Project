Customer Churn Prediction

Project Overview:
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses to retain customers and enhance customer satisfaction. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on various attributes such as call usage, service plans, and customer demographics.

Objective:
To build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning using machine learning techniques.

Data Description:
Source: https://data.world/bob-wakefield/call-center-data
Features: The dataset contains customer-related features, including:
total_day_minutes, total_eve_minutes, total_night_minutes: Call duration in different time segments.
total_day_charge, total_eve_charge, total_night_charge: Charges for calls.
international_plan, voice_mail_plan: Subscription details.
churn: Target variable (1 = Churn, 0 = No Churn).

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature encoding
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing feature distributions and correlations
Feature Engineering: Selecting the most important features for prediction
Model Training & Evaluation: Using algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
